ιο his iriend, and alterwardS, returning ιο louvain, became
a professor in the college. Ward having then dispatohed one
ol the brotherhood‚ Michael O'Clery into lreland, with a
view ol gathering the accessihlc materials in that country,
proceeded ιο arrange all that came ιο hand. During lilleen
years Michael O'Glery was diligently and unocasingly occu·
picd in his labours. For a period ol this time Florence Gray,
a native ol Thomond‚ was guardian ol the college, and per-
haps to him may hc traoed some ol the details ol St. Senaan
(this Saint was patron ol a great portion ol Thomond) that
alterwards appeared in the uncta Sanctorum u. however,
belone the collectione were completed, or heloro any portion
ol them was printed, Hugh Ward died in the year 1636.
Upon the death ol Ward this great work appears to he
suspended lor some time. however, another ol the brother-
hood‚ John Colgan,a native ol Denegat haring lound the
materiale to his hand, arranged and committed to the press
these volumes ol which we have spoken. The second is
dedicated to Thomas Fleming, one ol the consederate
bishups‚ and who had heen in early lile guardian and pro·
lessor ol this collegetitis need scarcely remind the render
ol the lame nl this work; the editor was classcd with Bollan-
dus ol the Jesuits, the most eminent divines praised it lor
learning and ahility. and poets wrote in praise ol the author :
Qui cupit hibernae regionis noscere gentem,
Et celebres tellus quos tulit illa patres;
Quid brevis usuram sallanem centenitatem,
Sollicita volvens mente manuque lihros?
tintcum calamus plures collimat in unum
Selenium ex multis suflicit illud opus.
ln the year 1667 there were about sixty students in the
college. Among them were two sous ol opunte, two vis·
counts and lour harcos, with many others ol distinguished
lamilics. Four missionaries, whose labours are proverbial,
were sent lrom this college into Scotland ι Cornelius Ward,
Paul O'Neil, Patrick liegerty and Patrich Brady. Edmond

carre, also ol this college, suffered martyrdom.
